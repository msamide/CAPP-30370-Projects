<h2>One of My Favorite Quotes Relating to Business</h2>
<p>"You should never start a company with the goal of getting rich. Your goal should be <strong>making something you believe in</strong> and making a company that will last."- Steve Jobs</p>

<h2>Goals/Plans After Graduation</h2>
<p>Personally, I want live in a place where I can happily call home. This is meant to very vague since I really don't know where I want to live yet. I was born and raised in the Midwest and have always loved the people and culture of the Midwest, but I have never liked the weather. So I could see myself living in the Midwest, one of the Carolinas, or Florida. Hopefully soon after or during college, I will be able to find a woman, <em>willing to marry me,</em> settle down, and start a family.</p>

<p>Professionally, I hope to be working at the intersection of business and technology. Both have always interested me and I know that they are going to be growing sectors in the coming years. It's possible I could work for a large corporation, a small startup, or forge my own path and start my own business. I love the independence, freedom and accmoplishment that comes with entrepreneurship so I am particularly drawn towards that.</p>

<h2>One of My Favorite Websites</h2>
<p>This is the website of the company I worked for this summer. I had a great time working for them and I may be doing some work for their website upon completion of this course.<br>
